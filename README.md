Okay, let's simplify the advanced version and make it neater, focusing on clarity and ease of use.  We'll remove some of the more complex elements (like Wakatime stats, trophies, and the typing SVG) and focus on the core information.  We'll also improve the layout for better readability.

Here's the simplified and neatened version:

```markdown
<div align="center">

**Key Changes and Explanations for Simplicity and Neatness:**

1.  **Removed Complex Elements:**
    *   **Typing SVG:**  Removed.  While cool, it's not essential for simplicity.
    *   **Wakatime Stats:** Removed. Requires extra setup and is not core information.
    *   **Trophies:** Removed.  A nice-to-have, but not crucial.
    *   **Visitor Counter:** Removed.
    *   **Buy Me a Coffee:** Removed (optional feature).
    *   **Time Banner:** Removed.
    * **Collapsible Skill Section:** Removed the details/summary tags.

2.  **Simplified Skills Section:**
    *   **Bullet Point List:**  Instead of badges or a table, we use a simple, clear bullet-point list. This is the easiest to read and maintain.  It's also less likely to cause rendering issues.
    *   **Categories:**  We group skills into logical categories (Languages, Frameworks, Tools, etc.) to improve organization.
    *   **Comma-Separated Lists:**  Within each category, list your skills separated by commas. This keeps it concise.

3.  **Concise "About Me":**
    *   **Fewer Bullet Points:**  Reduced the number of bullet points to the most important ones.
    *   **Brief Descriptions:**  Encourage short, concise descriptions for projects and learning.

4.  **GitHub Stats:**
    *   **`hide_border=true`:** Added this to the `github-readme-stats` URLs to remove the border around the stats images, making them look cleaner.  This is a subtle but important improvement.
    *    **Two Images Only:**  We keep the overall stats and the top languages, as these are the most informative.
    * **Horizontal layout:** The two images will display side by side.

5.  **Social Media Icons:**
    *   **`br` Tags:** Added `<br><br>` after the icons to create a clear separation from the Skills section. The double `<br>` adds extra spacing.
    *    **Alignment:** align=left added.

6.  **Consistent Formatting:**
    *   **Consistent Use of Headings:**  `##` for all main sections.
    *   **Clear Placeholders:** `[ ]` placeholders are easy to spot and replace.

7.  **Markdown Best Practices:**
    *   **Horizontal Rule:** `---` creates a visual separator at the end.

**Why this is "neater" and "simpler":**

*   **Less Visual Clutter:**  Fewer elements on the page make it easier to focus on the key information.
*   **Easier to Maintain:**  The simplified Skills section is much easier to update as you learn new skills.
*   **Reduced Risk of Rendering Issues:**  Simpler Markdown is less likely to break or render unexpectedly.
*   **Faster to Create:**  This version is quicker to set up because you don't need to configure external services (like Wakatime) or find badge URLs.
*   **Focus on Core Information:**  It emphasizes the most important aspects: who you are, what you're learning, your skills, and how to connect with you.

This revised version provides a clean, professional, and easy-to-maintain GitHub profile README. It prioritizes clarity and simplicity while still showcasing your key information effectively. Remember to replace the placeholders!
